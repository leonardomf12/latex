	\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,\\
	\\
	I am excited to apply for the Research position at INESCTEC. With a strong background in physics and machine learning, I am confident that I can bring valuable contributions to your team.\\
	\\
	Over the past year, I have been developing my masterâ€™s thesis in collaboration with a Portuguese start-up, focusing on optimizing the company's state-of-the-art machine learning architectures to enhance detection performance in a production line system. During this time, I strengthened my expertise in Python, working extensively with frameworks such as TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, as well as SQL, with a particular emphasis on PostgreSQL databases. Additionally, I also provided ongoing support to the team, contributing to various tasks as needed which allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in building and managing data pipelines, as well as deploying applications using mainly Docker and Kubernetes. \\
	\\
	I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join the INESCTEC team, as I see great potential for both personal and professional growth, as well as a future possibility to pursue a PhD. My interest in the position was further reinforced after taking the initiative to review the latest articles published by your research team on biometrics, which deepened my enthusiasm for this role. I believe my proactive approach and eagerness to learn align well with the qualities you are looking for, and I am eager to contribute to the continued success of your team.\\
	\\
	Thank you for considering my application.\\
	Best regards,\\
	Leonardo Machado Ferreira\\
